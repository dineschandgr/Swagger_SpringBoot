Swagger is a Tool to

- Develop API
- Interact with API
- Document APIs using Swagger UI


- Generates Auto generated API document from the meta data in the code

- Can generate in multiple forms like json, html

- When API changes, developer just need to update the API metadata. Swagger will update the documentation automatically


- Now it is called as OpenAPI



Steps

1. Add Swagger Spring Dependency

2. Enabking swagger in the code

3. COnfigure Swagger

4. Add details as annotations to API



Endpoint for accessing docs as json

http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs


Endpoint for accessing docs as html

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


Docket Object

- Contains all information about the config
- Docket Object 

Lof of annotations provided like

@ApiOperation
@ApiParam
@ApiModel
@ApiModelProperty


Drawbacks

- Lot of annoying annotations which increase the numbe rof lines of code
- In acse of circular dependencies between model objects, swagger wont work
