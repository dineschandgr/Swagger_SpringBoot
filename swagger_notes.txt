Swagger is a Tool to

- Develop API
- Interact with API
- Document APIs using Swagger UI

- Generates Auto generated API document from the meta data in the code

- Can generate in multiple forms like json, html

- When API changes, developer just need to update the API metadata. Swagger will update the documentation automatically

- Now it is called as OpenAPI 3

Steps

1. Add Swagger Spring Dependency

2. Enabking swagger in the code

3. Configure Swagger

4. Add details as annotations to API

Endpoint for accessing docs as json

http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs

Endpoint for accessing docs as html

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


Docket Object

- Contains all information about the config
- Docket Object 

Lof of annotations provided like

@ApiOperation
@ApiParam
@ApiModel
@ApiModelProperty

Drawbacks

- Lot of annoying annotations which increase the number of lines of code
- In case of circular dependencies between model objects, swagger wont work

The alternative option is to use Spring Rest Docs
